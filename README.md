### Dependencies:
* Ruby (2.6.1)
* Bundler (2.1.4)
* Rails (6.0.3.1)
* Google Chrome (80.0.3987.149)

### Installation:
Assuming you already have all previously listed dependencies installed, download this entire git repository to your computer and place in your desired install directory. Via a terminal interface navigate to ```install_directory/backend```. From this location execute ```bundle install``` to install all other required ruby gems. 

### Running:
This project was designed as a proof of concept so it requires hosting locally. To start hosting the local server navigate to ```install_directory/backend``` via a terminal interface and then execute ```rails s```. Next, from your Google Chrome browser navigate to your ```install_directory/frontend/index.html```. At this point the application will load and all functionality will be available.
